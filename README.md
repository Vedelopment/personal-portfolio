##Future Updates:
1. get jQuery headline onclick function to work
2. incorporate "fun" into other sections or blend these moz-border-radius
3. Continue styling sections, make these more sectional (change background color?)

#Feedback from classmates:
- make main section formatted to fill screen as in, don't have half the photo below it showing
- carry the sense of fun from the bottom through to the other sections
- make each section more distinct visually maybe with headers or different background color
- wish there was more color on the top part of the page
- wonder if narrowing the width of the lines of text would make the site feel easier to read on the eyes
